# roman_numeral_converter

This program (designed to run from the command line) takes inputs as either decimal integers or Roman numerals, and converts them into the opposite.

[converter.exe](https://github.com/bv-armstrong/roman_numeral_converter/blob/master/converter.exe) is a stand-alone executable with the external libraries used included.

[main.cpp](https://github.com/bv-armstrong/roman_numeral_converter/blob/master/main.cpp) and [RomanNumeralConverter.h](https://github.com/bv-armstrong/roman_numeral_converter/blob/master/RomanNumeralConverter.h) contain the source code, written in C++.

The project took 3 hours to complete.
